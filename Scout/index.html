                            <p>In Gerakan Pramuka, we will participate 
                                in various fun activities such as Camping (Kemah),
                                Exploration (Jelajah), Marching (Baris berbaris),
                                and Competition (Lomba tingkat). These actvities are fun
                                and targeted to form our own character to become independent
                                and can be very useful as we get many new knowledge.
                                With the 2013 education curriculum in effect, it is compulsory 
                                for all Indonesian students to join the scout movement as scouting
                                is officially one of the study units in the curriculum. This
                                 contributes to the movement's recognition as the world's largest. 
                                 It has 21,599,748 members (as of 2011),[2] making 
                                 it the world's largest Scout association.

                            <h1>Campsite (Kemah)</h1>
                              <p>Campsite (Kemah) is the biggest activity of Scout organizations that is carried
                                out outdoors. Usually the camp is held as an assessment as well as the
                                closing of a series of activities for one year. The activity material
                                in scout camp activities is adjusted to the level of competence that needs
                                to be mastered at a certain level. In general, camping for scouts is useful 
                                for practicing independence. By participating in these activities, the character
                                or personality of each member can be seen through each activity and behavior in
                                every situation that is being experienced. As the largest activity of an organization, 
                                preparation is needed for its implementation. Preparations for scout camping must
                                also be carried out so that all stages of the activity can run well.

                            <p> In Pramuka, marching is a mandatory material that should be studied. The marching training teaches scouts
                                to live an orderly and orderly life every day. Quoting from the book The Official Scout Guide (2015) by 
                                Zuli Agus Firmansyah, what is meant by marching is a manifestation of physical exercise aimed at instilling 
                                habits in order to form a certain character. The marching training not only trains the character formation 
                                of the scout members, but also trains the physical and forms responsibility. In addition, marching also instills 
                                an attitude of discipline and patriotism.
